# Code Cleanup Tasks

## Completed Performance Optimizations ✅
1. Multi-level caching with Redis + LRU cache and compression
2. Request batching and aggregation for efficient processing
3. Redis connection pooling and circuit breaker pattern
4. Memory optimization with automated garbage collection
5. Static asset optimization and response caching
6. Rate limiting with LRU cache
7. Performance monitoring and profiling
8. Request queue management

## Code Cleanup Tasks
1. ✓ Remove duplicate constructor in PerformanceMonitoringService
2. ✓ Clean up unused imports
3. ✓ Standardize error handling
4. ✓ Add proper typing for all parameters
5. ✓ Add missing interfaces
6. ✓ Clean up redundant code in monitoring services
7. ✓ Standardize configuration management
8. ✓ Add proper cleanup methods for services
9. ✓ Improve code organization

## Patterns to Enforce
1. Consistent error handling using custom errors
2. Standardized metrics collection
3. Consistent use of dependency injection
4. Proper initialization/cleanup lifecycle
5. Standardized configuration usage
6. Type-safe interfaces throughout
7. Proper monitoring integration
