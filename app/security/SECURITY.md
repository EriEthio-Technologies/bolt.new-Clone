# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures and practices implemented in the Code Editor application.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Authentication
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Refresh tokens handled securely
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Document-level permissions
- API endpoint authorization middleware

## Data Security

### Database Security
- Encrypted at rest
- SSL/TLS for connections
- Regular backups
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

### File Storage
- Encrypted uploads
- Virus scanning
- File type validation
- Size limits enforced

## API Security

### Request Security
- Input validation
- Request rate limiting
- CORS policy
- CSRF protection

### Response Security
- Security headers
- Content Security Policy
- Error handling (no sensitive data)
- Response sanitization

## Network Security

### TLS/SSL
- TLS 1.3 required
- Strong cipher suites
- HSTS enabled
- Certificate rotation

### Infrastructure
- VPC configuration
- Security groups
- WAF rules
- DDoS protection

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Security Monitoring
