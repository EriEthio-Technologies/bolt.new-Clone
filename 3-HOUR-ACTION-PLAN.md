- [ ] Complete security scanning setup
  - Finish EndpointScanner implementation
  - Configure security policies in k8s

### 2. Monitoring & Alerts Setup (45 minutes)
- [ ] Complete alert system implementation
  - Configure monitoring-config.yaml
  - Set up alert thresholds
  - Implement notification channels
- [ ] Implement full performance monitoring
  - Configure metrics collection
  - Set up dashboards
  - Enable log-based metrics

### 3. Core Feature Completion (30 minutes)
