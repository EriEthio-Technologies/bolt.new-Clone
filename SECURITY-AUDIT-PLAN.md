# Security Audit Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security audit plan for the monitoring system and overall application security.

## Audit Schedule

### Phase 1: Immediate Security Review (Week 1-2)
- [x] Review JWT implementation and settings
- [x] Audit security monitoring thresholds
- [x] Review network policies and access controls
- [x] Verify logging and monitoring coverage

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Security Assessment (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Authentication system security review
- [ ] Authorization mechanism audit
- [ ] Data encryption assessment
- [ ] API security testing
- [ ] Network security evaluation
- [ ] Container security review
- [ ] Secrets management audit

### Phase 3: Performance Security (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Load testing security implications
- [ ] DDoS protection assessment
- [ ] Rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Resource exhaustion prevention
- [ ] Memory management security

## Security Testing Methodologies

### 1. Static Analysis
- Code security scanning
- Dependencies vulnerability check
- Configuration review
- Secret detection

### 2. Dynamic Analysis
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Runtime analysis
- Fuzzing tests

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- Kubernetes security audit
- Network policy testing
- Service mesh security
- Cloud security review

## Focus Areas

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT implementation
- Session management
- Permission systems
- Access control mechanisms

### 2. Data Security
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Data validation
- Input sanitization

### 3. Monitoring & Detection
