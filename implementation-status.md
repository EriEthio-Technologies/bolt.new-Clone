# Implementation Status Report

## 1. API Rate Limiting Implementation Status
- Basic rate limiter class structure exists
- Missing implementation of distributed rate limiting with Redis/Memcached
- Need to add rate limit bypass for certain roles/IPs
- Need proper error handling and response formatting

## 2. Alert System Implementation Status
- Basic alert configuration exists
- Missing critical alerts for:
  - API availability
  - Error rate thresholds
  - Resource utilization
- Need to implement alert grouping and deduplication
- Missing proper alert routing based on severity

## 3. Security Measures Status
- Basic network and pod security policies exist
- Missing:
  - RBAC fine-tuning
  - Secret management improvements
  - Security context constraints
  - Network policy for egress traffic
  - Container vulnerability scanning

## 4. Test Coverage Status
- Basic e2e test structure exists
- Missing:
  - Rate limiting tests
  - Security policy tests
  - Alert system integration tests
  - Load testing scenarios
  - API endpoint coverage

## Action Items
1. Implement distributed rate limiting with Redis
2. Add comprehensive alert rules and routing
3. Enhance security policies and add vulnerability scanning
4. Expand test coverage across all components
