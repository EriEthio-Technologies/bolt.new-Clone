# Implementation Report

## Completed Tasks

### 1. VPC Connector Setup
- Updated VPC connector configuration in Terraform (`vpc.tf`)
  - Set machine type to f1-micro
  - Configured min (2) and max (10) instances
  - Set throughput to MODERATE
  - Aligned name with Kubernetes configuration
- Verified VPC connector configuration in Kubernetes (`gcp-vpc-connector.yaml`)
  - Configurations are now consistent between Terraform and Kubernetes
  - IP CIDR range is properly set
  - Resource limits and scaling parameters are defined

### 2. Document Processing Features
- Implemented PDFProcessor class
  - Basic PDF parsing and content extraction
  - Metadata extraction (title, author, creation date, page count)
  - Error handling and validation
- Set up document validation
  - Content validation (empty document check)
  - Page count validation
  - Metadata validation
  - Support for PDF mime type
  - Extensible validation framework

## Testing
The implemented features can be tested using the following methods:
1. VPC Connector: Apply Terraform configuration and verify in GCP Console
2. Document Processing: Use the DocumentProcessor class with PDF files to validate:
   - Content extraction
   - Metadata parsing
   - Validation rules
   - Error handling

## Notes
- The implementation allows for easy extension of validation rules
- Error handling is comprehensive across all components
- Infrastructure configurations are aligned and consistent
