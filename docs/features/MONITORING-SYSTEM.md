# Monitoring System Documentation

## Overview
The monitoring system provides comprehensive security and performance monitoring capabilities with real-time alerts and configurable thresholds.

## Components

### 1. Security Monitoring
- **Service**: `SecurityMonitoringService`
- **Configuration**: Located in `k8s/monitoring/security-monitoring.yaml`
- **Features**:
  - Failed login attempt detection
  - Suspicious activity monitoring
  - Unauthorized access alerts
  - Real-time event tracking
- **Intervals**:
  - Security checks: Every 60 seconds
  - Metric collection: Every 30 seconds
  - Log analysis: Every 5 minutes

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- **Service**: `PerformanceMonitoringService`
- **Features**:
  - CPU usage monitoring
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Response time analysis
  - Error rate monitoring
- **Thresholds**:
  - CPU usage: 80%
  - Memory usage: 85%
  - Response time: 1000ms
  - Error rate: 5%

## Implementation Details

### Security Monitoring
```typescript
// Example usage
const securityMonitoring = SecurityMonitoringService.getInstance();
await securityMonitoring.monitorSecurityEvents();
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Example usage
const performanceMonitoring = PerformanceMonitoringService.getInstance();
await performanceMonitoring.monitorPerformance();
```

## Alert System

### Alert Levels
- LOW: Informational alerts
- MEDIUM: Requires attention
- HIGH: Immediate action needed
- CRITICAL: Critical security threat

### Alert Configuration
Alerts are configured through Kubernetes ConfigMaps and can be adjusted per environment.

## Metrics Collection
- Uses Prometheus for metrics storage
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Custom metrics exposed via /metrics endpoint

## Best Practices
1. Regular threshold review
2. Alert response planning
3. Regular monitoring system health checks
4. Proper error handling
5. Resource usage optimization

## Integration
The monitoring system is integrated with:
- Kubernetes monitoring
- Logging system
- Alert notification system
- Security incident response system
