# Gobeze AI: AI-Powered Full-Stack Web Development

Gobeze AI is an AI-powered web development tool that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browserâ€”no local setup required.

## What Makes Gobeze AI Different

Our platform stands out with these key features:

- **Full-Stack in the Browser**: Gobeze AI provides a complete in-browser development environment powered by modern web technologies. This allows you to:
  - Install and manage npm packages
  - Run Node.js servers
  - Edit code in real-time
  - Deploy applications
  - Debug with full console access

- **AI with Environment Control**: Unlike traditional dev environments where the AI can only assist in code generation, Gobeze AI gives AI models **complete control** over the entire environment including the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console. This empowers AI agents to handle the entire development workflow.

Whether you're an experienced developer, a PM or designer, Gobeze AI allows you to build production-grade full-stack applications with ease.

## Getting Started

Here are some tips to get the most out of Gobeze AI:

1. **Be Specific**: When describing what you want to build, be as specific as possible. Include details about:
   - Desired functionality
   - UI/UX preferences
   - Technical requirements
   - Performance expectations

2. **Iterative Development**: Break down complex features into smaller tasks and work iteratively.

3. **Review & Refine**: Always review the AI's output and provide feedback to refine the results.

## Deployment

The application is deployed to Google Cloud Platform. Make sure you have the necessary GCP credentials and permissions set up before deploying.
